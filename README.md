# churn-prediction-with-pyspark-and-keras
A distributed approach for data exploration, and neural net training prediction and scoring. The modules are intended to handle large datasets by only operating in batches. The specific problem studied here is related to predicting the churn ratio (i.e., the amount of customers that leave a service) from a telecommunications company.
